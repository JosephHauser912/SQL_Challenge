# SQL_Challenge

A challenge designed by EdX

I used SQLAlchemy to create a session based on a create_engine of an existing sqlite file that was provided.

Inside that engine were two classes, which I queried into using datetime to analyze Hawaii's precipitation
by year and later month.



![Prec in Inches](https://github.com/JosephHauser912/SQL_Challenge/assets/67341300/e0821a15-40e0-4094-9b98-95783d844620)
I was also able to query into specific weather stations to see specific precipitation scores, namely in the last year. 


![TempObs](https://github.com/JosephHauser912/SQL_Challenge/assets/67341300/387a7fce-4653-471d-afeb-ab93826bbbf4)
I also created a query to display the last twelve months of temperature observation data for the most active station and plot it
as a histogram.
