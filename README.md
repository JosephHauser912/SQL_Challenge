# SQL_Challenge

A challenge designed by EdX

I used SQLAlchemy to create a session based on a create_engine of an existing sqlite file that was provided.

Inside that engine were two classes, which I queried into using datetime to analyze Hawaii's precipitation
by year and later month.

I was also able to query into specific weather stations to see specific precipitation scores, namely in the last year.

I also created a query to display the last twelve months of temperature observation data for the most active station and plot it
as a histogram.
